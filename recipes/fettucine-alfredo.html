    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Fettucine Pasta</li>
        <li>6 Tabelspoons Butter</li>
        <li>1 Garlic Clove (minced)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Peper</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Italian Parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the water over high until it is boiling. Add salt to season
            the water before it boils. Once it starts boiling, add fettuccine and cook according
            to the package instructions.
        </li>
        <li> Heat butter over on medium heat in a large skillet/pan.
             Add minced butter and let it cook for about 1-2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.</li>
             <li>Let the heavy cream reduce and cook for about 5-8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan
                cheese into the mixture and whisk it until it is smooth. Keep it over heat and 
                whisk until the cheese is melted.
             </li>
             <li>Save some of the water from the pasta. Do this because the water is full of flavor
                and it can be used to thin out the sauce.
             </li>
             <li>Toss the alfredo sauce with the fettucine pasta and add half of the parmesan.
                Once it is tossed, garnish it with the remaining parmesan cheese and add a little
                pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.
             </li>
             <li>Garnish the dish with Italian parsley if it is desired.</li>
    </ol>
