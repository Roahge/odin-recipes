    <h3 class="ingredients-header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="recipe-list ul-list">
        <li>Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh Mozzarella Balls</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil</li>
        <li>Olive Oil & Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
        <li>Prepare the dough</li>
        <li>Place mixing bowl into the sink and pour the canned tomatoes into the bowl,
            juices and all. Crush the tomatoes by hand and spread about 3/4 cup of the tomato
            sauce evenly over each pizza, leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>If mozzarella is packed in water make sure to drain it off and gently dry onto a clean towel or paper towel.
            If working with large mozzarella balls, tear them into smaller 1-inch balls and distribute it over the pizza,
            concentrating around the center so it melts towards the edges.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the pizzas on the top rack of the oven until the crust is golden and cheese is just turning golden.
            Usually around 10-12 minutes, but can take less if you are using a baking stone/steel.
        </li>
        <li>Generously top each pizza with fresh basil, as well as a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of salt,
            and red pepper flakes as desired. Slice the pizza and enjoy! (Leftover pizza will keep well in fridge for up to 4 days.)
        </li>
