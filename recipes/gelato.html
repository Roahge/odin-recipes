    <h2>If you want ice cream, but want it more Italian then this is for you!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium egg yolks</li>
        <li>150 g (3/4 cup) of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>350ml (1 1/2 cup) of whole milk</li>
        <li>250 ml (1 cup) of heavy cream</li>
        <li>A little grated lemon zest or vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps (Requires Ice Cream Maker)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a mixer, whip the egg yolks with the sugar at max speed for about 5 minutes,
            until you have a soft fluffy cream.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the milk in a saucepan and bring it nearly to a boil, and let cook for about 5 minutes (Do not let the milk reach boiling)</li>
        <li>Transfer the egg and sugar fluffy cream to a saucepan. Pour the hot milk slowly into the cream.
            Make sure to keep mixing during this process. If you would like to flavor the gelato now would be the time to 
            add either the lemon zest or 2 drops of vanilla extract. Put the mixture back onto heat and let it 
            cook for about another 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add cold heavy cream and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker and start it. After about 40 minutes your gelato should be ready!</li>
    </ol>
